This is the first website I have ever made using HTML and CSS. The website stands as my online portfolio and consists of three pages:
1. index.html
2. bio.html
3. resume.html

The bio and resume page both use the same stylesheet: hw1css.css. index.html uses index_style.css.

The color-scheme is very uniform throughout the website, but at the moment, the pages do look a little bland. I plan to come back and polish them.
